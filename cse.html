            <p>The Department of Computer Science & Engineering, established in 1986, offers UG, PG and research (leading to M.Sc. and Ph.D.) programs. The Department practices outcome-based education since 2014. With state-of-the-art laboratories and other supporting facilities to provide enhanced learning environment, the Department boasts of well qualified teaching faculty with rich research, teaching and industrial experience.</p>
            <p>The Department has excellent placement track record in reputed industries with an average of 80 – 85% placement of eligible students over the years. The Department regularly conducts audit courses, and special courses on advanced topics, to bridge the gap between the curriculum and the need of the industry. The Department offers M.Tech programs in Computer Science & Engineering and Cyber Security. From the year 2022-23 M.Tech program is under Nitte University..</p>
            <p>Program Outcomes:
                 <p> PO1: Engineering knowledge: Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems.</p>
                  <p>PO2: Problem analysis: Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences.
                  <p>PO3: Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations.</p>
                  <p>P04: Conduct investigations of complex problems: Use research-based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis, and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.</p>
                  <p>PO5: Modern tool usage: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modeling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations.</p>
                  <p>PO6: The engineer and society: Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice.</p>
                  <p>PO7: Environment and sustainability: Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and the need for sustainable development.</p>
